# Setup User Containers for LXC (for Debian/Ubuntu based systems)

If you've used LXC for quick test machines, or any other purpose, this will
allow you to run them without being root.

I've tested it on Ubutnu 20.04 - 22.04, and on Debian 11, but YMMV.  I
figured this might be helpful for someone!
